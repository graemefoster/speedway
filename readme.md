# Speedway

## Speedway is no longer being maintained

## Concept
Speedway provides an application / api abstraction over core cloud platforms making it simple to setup complient devops CI/CD pipelines, and automated pipelines to deploy APIs with storage, authentication, authorisation and persistance.

he aim was to remove tight coupling to underlying cloud platforms allowing business feature teams to focus on delivering value without concerning themselves about the underlying platforms.

It was put to rest in June 2021.

Hopefully the code base will continue to help people with automating Azure DevOps pipelines, and using the Azure SDK.

Thanks,

Graeme
